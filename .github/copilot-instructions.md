Summary (quick): Unity 6.0.0.59f2 project. Most development happens inside Assets/Scripts. Avoid touching generated or binary folders (Library/, Temp/, obj/, BuildProfiles/).

1) Big picture
- Unity game project (Editor version 6000.0.59f2 per `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`).
- C# assemblies are generated by Unity; main runtime code is in `Assets/Scripts` and compiles to `Assembly-CSharp` (see `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`).
- Code uses Unity component model: MonoBehaviour components under `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay`, `Core`, `UI`, etc. Example: `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Player/Movement/PlayerMotor.cs` (character controller-based movement, camera-forward movement, dash and charge-jump systems).

2) How to make safe edits
- Edit only files under `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/` unless explicitly modifying build tooling.
- Do NOT modify `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Packages/` cache files, or the generated `.csproj` unless you know Unity will re-generate them.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; Unity recompiles on file save. Small incremental commits are preferred.

3) Build / test / run guidance (discoverable)
- Open the project in Unity Hub using Unity 6000.0.59f2. Editor is the primary runtime and test environment.
- C# language level: 9.0 (see `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` <LangVersion>9.0</LangVersion>).
- Unit tests: Unity Test Framework is available (nunit referenced in csproj). Run tests from Unity Test Runner inside the Editor.
- IDE: Visual Studio / VS Code can be used. The csproj references Unity analyzers (paths present in `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`) — keep them installed for best diagnostics.

4) Project patterns & conventions (concrete)
- Folder layout: `Assets/Scripts/Core` (engine abstractions/interfaces), `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay` (gameplay systems), `Assets/Scripts/Data` (ScriptableObject data), `Assets/Scripts/UI` (UI components).
- Component-first code: Many classes are MonoBehaviours attached to GameObjects. Prefer editing component logic rather than changing scene bindings.
- Input: There is an `InputReader` component (e.g. used by `PlayerMotor`) and a generated `Core/PlayerInputActions.cs` — follow the input abstraction patterns.
- Movement: Player uses `CharacterController` and camera-forward movement (see `PlayerMotor.cs`). Use Camera.main cautiously — if refactoring, prefer injecting camera references.
- Dashes/jumps: Implemented with timers and arrays (see `dashRechargeTimers` in `PlayerMotor.cs`) — preserve logic semantics when modifying.

5) Integration points & external deps
- Unity packages (see Packages/manifest.json) and built-in modules are used heavily (Input System, TextMeshPro, URP). Check `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` references if you need analyzer context.
- No external CI config present in repo root (.github/ previously empty), so automated workflows may not be available.

6) AI agent rules for edits
- Prefer editing source files under `Assets/Scripts/*` and provide a minimal rationale comment at the top of changed files when behavior is non-obvious.
- When adding new public API (new MonoBehaviour fields or ScriptableObjects), include one-line usage examples and the scene or prefab that should reference it (if known).
- Avoid changing generated project files or large binary assets. If a change requires modifying Pipeline/Editor settings, state this explicitly and ask for human approval.

7) Examples to cite when making suggestions
- Movement/Character patterns: `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Player/Movement/PlayerMotor.cs`, `PlayerController.cs`, `PlayerJump.cs`, `PlayerDash.cs`.
- Input abstraction: `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Player/Movement/InputReader.cs` and `Assets/Scripts/Core/PlayerInputActions.cs`.
- Config/data: `Assets/Scripts/Data/GameSettings/GameSettings.cs`, `PlayerSettings.cs`.

8) What I couldn't discover
- No repo-level CI workflows found (.github/workflows not present). If you want CI-based testing or formatting checks, provide desired commands or a sample workflow.

If any section is unclear or you'd like the agent to include additional operational commands (Unity CLI build steps, preferred editor settings, or CI workflow snippet), tell me what to add and I'll iterate.
